## Breaking into the Tech Industry Part Three

We're continuing our breaking into tech series this week with an episode full of resume and portfolio tips!

Resumes, Portfolios, Cover Letters, Linkedin, and even your Github Heatmap are often your best and only chance to impress an employer and entice them into interviewing you. That's why Eddie and I think it's _so_ important that you make sure your resume and portfolio are on point.

This episode is chock-full of everything Eddie and I have learned about resumes and portfolios.
