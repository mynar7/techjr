## Developer Advocate jobs sure seem great!

[Sam Julien](https://samjulien.com) joins us again this week to talk about what it's like to work as a developer advocate for Auth0. We talk about building community, traveling (back when that was a thing) and how to manage a personal brand. If you're interested in developer relations (DevRel), this is the episode for you!

Sam also has a new **eBook** that will guide you to a career in DevRel! Check it out at [Sam's website.](https://learn.samjulien.com/getting-started-in-developer-relations)
