## Breaking into the Tech Industry Part Deux

We're continuing our breaking into tech series this week with bootcamps v college v self-taught learners.

So does it matter which route/path you take into tech? It's a question that's been asked many times and answered in twice as many ways.

We're biased as bootcamp grads ourselves, but we've worked with and interviewed computer science grads as well as self-taught developers. 

At the end of the day, we don't feel like the path matters as much as the person, but listen in to hear our justifications on this week's episode!
