## Breaking into the Tech Industry Part Four

We're continuing our breaking into tech series this week with some strategies for the job search.

As Eddie and I see it, there's two main strategies for looking for work: you either shotgun your resume to every available opportunity, or leverage your network to find leads where you might have a foot in the door already. It's sort of a hot vs cold approach. Hot leads always have better returns compared to cold.

That said, there's merit to both strategies, so tune in this week to hear our thoughts!
