## What kind of projects should you make for your portfolio?

I've often struggled with this question myself as a new developer. Especially in concert with learning React. Colby Fayock took this problem by the horns!

Colby is a developer advocate with Applitools. He's written books on [jamstack](https://jamstackhandbook.com) and [what React projects you can make](https://50reactprojects.com).

We get into JAMstack, portfolio projects, and more this week, so be sure to check it out!
